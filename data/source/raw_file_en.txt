# CONTEXT END

Well, finally. We've exchanged names at last.
She seems so out of touch with reality. Is it from awkwardness?

  KAYOSHI
  Hmm, "Erri"...
  Quite an unusual name.

  ELLI
  Yes, it's from my grandmother.
  And if you don't mind, it's pronounced "Ellie." With an "L."

  KAYOSHI
  Ah yes, that letter...
  Sorry, I'll have to get used to it.

Now I have to adapt to their foreign pronunciation.
Of course, I'll try out of politeness. But it's not like I want to make an effort for some pretty girl!

  ELLI
  No, it's nothing.
  I've already gotten used to how my name is pronounced in Japan.

  KAYOSHI
  That sounded kind of sad.

  ELLI
  It's no big deal. You don't have to adjust.
  Oh, and sorry if it's rude to be texting in company.

  KAYOSHI
  No big deal. I just felt a bit awkward... Haha!

  ELLI
  I just thought you might be tired of my chatter.

  KAYOSHI
  No, not at all.
  I mean, discussing the Overton Window with a complete stranger is kind of... odd.
  But since we're already walking through the city together, I wouldn't refuse the conversation.

  ELLI
  Alright, I understand.
